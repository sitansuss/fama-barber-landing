To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    https://github.com/sitansuss/fama-barber-landing
    cd fama-barber-landing-page
    

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Tailwind CSS, which requires Node.js and npm.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build/Watch Tailwind CSS:**
    To compile Tailwind CSS and watch for changes:
    ```bash

    This will generate the `css/output.css` file.
